  <p>A prominent and well-designed software in today’s world is Netflix. Netflix is an application software known to provide a large catalog of films and TV shows to its users, as well as exclusive content. One reason why the software is well designed is because of its simplicity and user-friendly interface. Netflix has a simple interface that includes large thumbnails for its content and allows users to navigate through categories effortlessly. Additionally, based on the user’s searches and the type of content they watch, Netflix uses highly advanced algorithms to recommend movies and shows that fit the user’s profile, therefore enhancing one’s overall entertainment experience. Netflix also oversees the simultaneous use of multiple devices, ensuring high-quality streaming with little to no software buffering and crashing. This indicates why Netflix is known to be one of the biggest streaming giants; due to its well designed software. Although software design is often overlooked when it comes to engineering, it happens to be one of the most important steps in determining the success of a product. A prime example is Facebook and MySpace. MySpace was one of the most used social networks of its time, however, it was quickly replaced by Facebook. The reasoning behind this is the difference in software design for both applications. MySpace developed various security issues, and could not fix the issues promptly, whereas Facebook had a much easier UI that appealed to the average consumer, along with more complex software that prevented security complications, and included elevated user functions. Software design is essential because it helps establish how the product is developed, such as its UI, security, and bug fixes; if a software is not well developed, it can lead to multiple issues and can potentially cause the product to fail.

<p>Requirements are known to be a set of operations that the software must perform and include a clear and concise description. There are two types of requirements, functional, which is requirements for what the system should do, and non-functional,  which is how the system would perform. Requirements are considered to be one of the most important stages in software design as they are the foundation of the next stages of the software design cycle. Some features of good requirements are that they are clear and concise, traceable, testable, and measurable. Requirements must also be prioritized, meaning that certain requirements are categorized differently, indicating the importance of each requirement. Without these conditions being met, it will lead to significant issues such as project delays which lead to increased costs. Furthermore, issues with requirements can lead to excessive and unnecessary requirements being added which have no relevance and stray away from the project. These requirements are created by the developers of the software, by interviewing clients, conducting in-depth research, surveys, and brainstorming. To keep them tracked, requirements are organized in a document that uniquely identify’s each requirement as well as easy to understand and access for developers. </p>

<p>  Communication is one of the most underrated factors when it comes to software design due to the fact it does not involve coding or physically designing the software product. However, communication is crucial as it can lead to either the success or failure of the design. All good software designs have good communication found in each stage such as requirements stage, design stage, implementation, etc. For example, a key element of communication can be found in the requirements stage where the client communicates with the designers. If the communication between the two sides isn’t detailed, then it can lead to circumstances where the product that was designed does not suit the client's vision of what they want their product to be, leading to an inflated budget for the product. Another key element is brainstorming; brainstorming is an excellent form of communication as it involves in-depth collaboration and choosing certain ideas to work with, making the design planning more straightforward and keeping everyone on the same page. A third key element of communication is technical reviews; this is an important piece of communication because it provides feedback on the ongoing software design so that changes to the design can be made more efficiently instead of editing the design once it’s been fully completed, thus saving time and money. A personal experience of a communication issue I had was in a high school group business project. The project had multiple components which we split upon ourselves, and required us to create an innovative product. However towards the end of the deadline we realized that some components that our group members did was not up to par with the reast and did not work. This situation could have been prevented by doing regular check-ins and giving feedback (technial reviews).

    One design principle that’s important is the simplicity principle. This principle is about keeping the software's design simple enough that it’s easy to understand for all users without sacrificing its efficiency. Additionally, the coding used for the design is simple and not overcomplicating; this is important since it helps boost user experience and makes it easy to debug/build upon. An example of where this principle helped a software excel past its competitors and become successful is with the Google homepage. Unlike many homepages that are cluttered with multiple pop-ups and advertisements, Google’s is more streamlined as it has a minimal interface with very few features present. Some of these features include their search bar, allowing users to search across the internet. Another feature is their “Waffle”, a 3x3 dotted square on the top right of Google’s homepage, giving users access to Google apps such as Gmail, and other apps such as YouTube. This minimalist homepage with its key features allowed their homepage page to be one of the most famous and used homepages instead of one such as Yahoo or Bing. Additionally, another example of the simplicity principle is found in Spotify’s redesign. When the software was first released in 2006, the app was required to navigate through multiple tabs to find features such as “create a playlist”, causing poor user experience. However, through multiple redesigns of their interface, making the UI much more appealing and easy to understand to users; this redesign allowed the app to take huge success as in 2012, Spotify had reached close to 20 million subscribers. Continuing with their quality of life changes to the interface, Spotify is now the most successful music streaming app, dominating competitors such as Apple Music as the app now has approximately 640 million active users monthly.
