  <p>A prominent and well-designed software in today’s world is Netflix. Netflix is an application software known to provide a large catalog of films and TV shows to its users, as well as exclusive content. One reason why the software is well designed is because of its simplicity and user-friendly interface. Netflix has a simple interface that includes large thumbnails for its content and allows users to navigate through categories effortlessly. Additionally, based on the user’s searches and the type of content they watch, Netflix uses highly advanced algorithms to recommend movies and shows that fit the user’s profile, therefore enhancing one’s overall entertainment experience. Netflix also oversees the simultaneous use of multiple devices, ensuring high-quality streaming with little to no software buffering and crashing. This indicates why Netflix is known to be one of the biggest streaming giants; due to its well designed software. Although software design is often overlooked when it comes to engineering, it happens to be one of the most important steps in determining the success of a product. A prime example is Facebook and MySpace. MySpace was one of the most used social networks of its time, however, it was quickly replaced by Facebook. The reasoning behind this is the difference in software design for both applications. MySpace developed various security issues, and could not fix the issues promptly, whereas Facebook had a much easier UI that appealed to the average consumer, along with more complex software that prevented security complications, and included elevated user functions. Software design is essential because it helps establish how the product is developed, such as its UI, security, and bug fixes; if a software is not well developed, it can lead to multiple issues and can potentially cause the product to fail.
